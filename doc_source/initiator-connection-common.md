# Connecting iSCSI Initiators<a name="initiator-connection-common"></a>

When managing your gateway, you work with volumes or virtual tape library \(VTL\) devices that are exposed as Internet Small Computer System Interface \(iSCSI\) targets\. For Volume Gateways, the iSCSI targets are volumes\. For Tape Gateways, the targets are VTL devices\. As part of this work, you do such tasks as connecting to those targets, customizing iSCSI settings, connecting from a Red Hat Linux client, and configuring Challenge\-Handshake Authentication Protocol \(CHAP\)\.

+ [Customizing iSCSI Settings](#recommendediSCSISettings)
+ [Configuring CHAP Authentication for Your iSCSI Targets](#ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorCHAP)

The iSCSI standard is an Internet Protocol \(IP\)â€“based storage networking standard for initiating and managing connections between IP\-based storage devices and clients\. The following list defines some of the terms that are used to describe the iSCSI connection and the components involved\. 

**iSCSI initiator **  
The client component of an iSCSI network\. The initiator sends requests to the iSCSI target\. Initiators can be implemented in software or hardware\. Storage Gateway only supports software initiators\.

**iSCSI target**  
The server component of the iSCSI network that receives and responds to requests from initiators\. Each of your volumes is exposed as an iSCSI target\. Connect only one iSCSI initiator to each iSCSI target\.

**Microsoft iSCSI initiator**  
The software program on Microsoft Windows computers that enables you to connect a client computer \(that is, the computer running the application whose data you want to write to the gateway\) to an external iSCSI\-based array \(that is, the gateway\)\. The connection is made using the host computer's Ethernet network adapter card\. The Microsoft iSCSI initiator has been validated with Storage Gateway on Windows 8\.1, Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, and Windows Server 2019\. The initiator is built into these operating systems\. 

**Red Hat iSCSI initiator**  
The `iscsi-initiator-utils` Resource Package Manager \(RPM\) package provides you with an iSCSI initiator implemented in software for Red Hat Linux\. The package includes a server daemon for the iSCSI protocol\.

Each type of gateway can connect to iSCSI devices, and you can customize those connections, as described following\.

## Connecting Your VTL Devices to a Windows client<a name="ConfiguringiSCSIClient-vtl"></a>

A Tape Gateway exposes several tape drives and a media changer, referred to collectively as VTL devices, as iSCSI targets\. For more information, see [Requirements](Requirements.md)\. 

**Note**  
You connect only one application to each iSCSI target\. 

The following diagram highlights the iSCSI target in the larger picture of the Storage Gateway architecture\. For more information on Storage Gateway architecture, see [How Tape Gateway works \(architecture\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/StorageGatewayConcepts.html)\.

## Connecting Your Volumes or VTL Devices to a Linux Client<a name="ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorRedHatClient"></a>

**Topics**

When using Red Hat Enterprise Linux \(RHEL\), you use the `iscsi-initiator-utils` RPM package to connect to your gateway iSCSI targets \(volumes or VTL devices\)\. 

**To connect a Linux client to the iSCSI targets**

1. Install the `iscsi-initiator-utils` RPM package, if it isn't already installed on your client\. 

   You can use the following command to install the package\.

   ```
   sudo yum install iscsi-initiator-utils
   ```

1. Ensure that the iSCSI daemon is running\.

   1. Verify that the iSCSI daemon is running using one of the following commands\.

      For RHEL 5 or 6, use the following command\.

      ```
      sudo /etc/init.d/iscsi status
      ```

      For RHEL 7, use the following command\.

      ```
      sudo service iscsid status
      ```

   1. If the status command doesn't return a status of *running*, start the daemon using one of the following commands\.

      For RHEL 5 or 6, use the following command\.

      ```
      sudo /etc/init.d/iscsi start
      ```

      For RHEL 7, use the following command\. For RHEL 7, you usually don't need to explicitly start the `iscsid` service\.

      ```
      sudo service iscsid start
      ```

1. To discover the volume or VTL device targets defined for a gateway, use the following discovery command\.

   ```
   sudo /sbin/iscsiadm --mode discovery --type sendtargets --portal [GATEWAY_IP]:3260
   ```

   Substitute your gateway's IP address for the *\[GATEWAY\_IP\]* variable in the preceding command\. You can find the gateway IP in the **iSCSI Target Info** properties of a volume on the Storage Gateway console\. 

   The output of the discovery command will look like the following example output\.

   For Volume Gateways: `[GATEWAY_IP]:3260, 1 iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume `

   For Tape Gateways: `iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:[GATEWAY_IP]-tapedrive-01`

   Your iSCSI qualified name \(IQN\) will be different than what is shown preceding, because IQN values are unique to an organization\. The name of the target is the name that you specified when you created the volume\. You can also find this target name in the **iSCSI Target Info** properties pane when you select a volume on the Storage Gateway console\.

1. To connect to a target, use the following command\.

   Note that you need to specify the correct *\[GATEWAY\_IP\]* and IQN in the connect command\.
**Warning**  
For gateways that are deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance, accessing the gateway over a public internet connection is not supported\. The Elastic IP address of the Amazon EC2 instance cannot be used as the target address\. 

   ```
   sudo /sbin/iscsiadm --mode node --targetname iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:[ISCSI_TARGET_NAME] --portal [GATEWAY_IP]:3260,1 --login
   ```

1. To verify that the volume is attached to the client machine \(the initiator\), use the following command\.

   ```
   ls -l /dev/disk/by-path
   ```

   The output of the command will look like the following example output\.

   `lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 9 Apr 16 19:31 ip-[GATEWAY_IP]:3260-iscsi-iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume-lun-0 -> ../../sda`

   We highly recommend that after you set up your initiator, you customize your iSCSI settings as discussed in [Customizing Your Linux iSCSI Settings](#CustomizeLinuxiSCSISettings)\.

## Customizing iSCSI Settings<a name="recommendediSCSISettings"></a>

After you set up your initiator, we highly recommend that you customize your iSCSI settings to prevent the initiator from disconnecting from targets\.

By increasing the iSCSI timeout values as shown in the following steps, you make your application better at dealing with write operations that take a long time and other transient issues such as network interruptions\.

**Note**  
Before making changes to the registry, you should make a backup copy of the registry\. For information on making a backup copy and other best practices to follow when working with the registry, see [Registry best practices](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc780921(WS.10).aspx) in the *Microsoft TechNet Library*\.

### Customizing Your Windows iSCSI Settings<a name="CustomizeWindowsiSCSISettings"></a>

For a Tape Gateway setup, connecting to your VTL devices by using a Microsoft iSCSI initiator is a two\-step process: 

1. Connect your Tape Gateway devices to your Windows client\.

1. If you are using a backup application, configure the application to use the devices\.

The Getting Started example setup provides instructions for both these steps\. It uses the Symantec NetBackup backup application\. For more information, see [Connecting Your VTL Devices](GettingStarted-create-tape-gateway.md#GettingStartedAccessTapesVTL) and [Configuring NetBackup Storage Devices](backup_netbackup-vtl.md#configure-netback-storage-devices)\. 

**To customize your Windows iSCSI settings**

1. Increase the maximum time for which requests are queued\.

   1. Start Registry Editor \(`Regedit.exe`\)\.

   1. Navigate to the globally unique identifier \(GUID\) key for the device class that contains iSCSI controller settings, shown following\.

       
**Warning**  
Make sure that you are working in the **CurrentControlSet** subkey and not another control set, such as **ControlSet001** or **ControlSet002**\.

       

      ```
      HKEY_Local_Machine\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E97B-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}
      ```

   1. Find the subkey for the Microsoft iSCSI initiator, shown following as *\[<Instance Number\]*\.

      The key is represented by a four\-digit number, such as `0000`\. 

       

      ```
      HKEY_Local_Machine\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E97B-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}\[<Instance Number]
      ```

      Depending on what is installed on your computer, the Microsoft iSCSI initiator might not be the subkey `0000`\. You can ensure that you have selected the correct subkey by verifying that the string `DriverDesc` has the value `Microsoft iSCSI Initiator`, as shown in the following example\.

         
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/images/iscsi-windows-registry-10.png)

   1. To show the iSCSI settings, choose the **Parameters** subkey\.

   1. Open the context \(right\-click\) menu for the **MaxRequestHoldTime** DWORD \(32\-bit\) value, choose **Modify**, and then change the value to **600**\.

      This value represents a hold time of 600 seconds\. The example following shows the **MaxRequestHoldTime** DWORD value with a value of 600\.

         
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/images/iscsi-windows-registry-20.png)

1. You can increase the maximum amount of data that can be sent in iSCSI packets by modifying the following parameters:
   + **FirstBurstLength** controls the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted in an unsolicited write request\. Set this value to **262144** or the Windows OS default, whichever is higher\.
   + **MaxBurstLength** is similar to **FirstBurstLength**, but it sets the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted in solicited write sequences\. Set this value to **1048576** or the Windows OS default, whichever is higher\.
   + **MaxRecvDataSegmentLength** controls the maximum data segment size that is associated with a single protocol data unit \(PDU\)\. Set this value to **262144** or the Windows OS default, whichever is higher\.

     
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/images/registry_selected.png)
**Note**  
Different backup software can be optimized to work best using different iSCSI settings\. To verify which values for these parameters will provide the best performance, see the documentation for your backup software\.

1. Increase the disk timeout value, as shown following:

   1. Start Registry Editor \(`Regedit.exe`\), if you haven't already\.

   1. Navigate to the **Disk** subkey in the **Services** subkey of the **CurrentControlSet**, shown following\.

      ```
      HKEY_Local_Machine\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Disk
      ```

   1. Open the context \(right\-click\) menu for the **TimeOutValue** DWORD \(32\-bit\) value, choose **Modify**, and then change the value to **600**\.

      This value represents a timeout of 600 seconds\. The example following shows the **TimeOutValue** DWORD value with a value of 600\.

         
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/images/iscsi-windows-registry-30.png)

1. To ensure that the new configuration values take effect, restart your system\.

   Before restarting, you must make sure that the results of all write operations to volumes are flushed\. To do this, take any mapped storage volume disks offline before restarting\.

### Customizing Your Linux iSCSI Settings<a name="CustomizeLinuxiSCSISettings"></a>

After setting up the initiator for your gateway, we highly recommend that you customize your iSCSI settings to prevent the initiator from disconnecting from targets\. By increasing the iSCSI timeout values as shown following, you make your application better at dealing with write operations that take a long time and other transient issues such as network interruptions\.

**Note**  
Commands might be slightly different for other types of Linux\. The following examples are based on Red Hat Linux\.

**To customize your Linux iSCSI settings**

1. Increase the maximum time for which requests are queued\.

   1. Open the `/etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf` file and find the following lines\.

      ```
      node.session.timeo.replacement_timeout = [replacement_timeout_value] 
      node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_interval = [noop_out_interval_value] 
      node.conn[0].timeo.noop_out_timeout = [noop_out_timeout_value]
      ```

   1. Set the *\[replacement\_timeout\_value\]* value to **600**\. 

      Set the *\[noop\_out\_interval\_value\]* value to **60**\.

      Set the *\[noop\_out\_timeout\_value\]* value to **600**\. 

      All three values are in seconds\.

       
**Note**  
The `iscsid.conf` settings must be made before discovering the gateway\. If you have already discovered your gateway or logged in to the target, or both, you can delete the entry from the discovery database using the following command\. Then you can rediscover or log in again to pick up the new configuration\.  
   

      ```
      iscsiadm -m discoverydb -t sendtargets -p [GATEWAY_IP]:3260 -o delete
      ```

1. Increase the maximum values for the amount of data that can be transmitted in each response\.

   1. Open the `/etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf` file and find the following lines\.

      ```
      node.session.iscsi.FirstBurstLength = [replacement_first_burst_length_value] 
      node.session.iscsi.MaxBurstLength = [replacement_max_burst_length_value]
      node.conn[0].iscsi.MaxRecvDataSegmentLength = [replacement_segment_length_value]
      ```

   1. We recommend the following values to achieve better performance\. Your backup software might be optimized to use different values, so see your backup software documentation for best results\.

      Set the *\[replacement\_first\_burst\_length\_value\]* value to **262144** or the Linux OS default, whichever is higher\.

      Set the *\[replacement\_max\_burst\_length\_value\]* value to **1048576** or the Linux OS default, whichever is higher\.

      Set the *\[replacement\_segment\_length\_value\]* value to **262144** or the Linux OS default, whichever is higher\.
**Note**  
Different backup software can be optimized to work best using different iSCSI settings\. To verify which values for these parameters will provide the best performance, see the documentation for your backup software\.

1. Restart your system to ensure that the new configuration values take effect\.

   Before restarting, make sure that the results of all write operations to your tapes are flushed\. To do this, unmount tapes before restarting\.

### Customizing Your Linux Disk Timeout Settings for Volume Gateways<a name="CustomizeLinuxDiskTimeoutSettings"></a>

If you are using a Volume Gateway, you can customize the following Linux disk timeout settings in addition to the iSCSI settings described in the preceding section\.

**To customize your Linux disk timeout settings**

1. Increase the disk timeout value in the rules file\.

   1. If you are using the RHEL 5 initiator, open the `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules` file, and find the following line\.

      ```
      ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="scsi" , SYSFS{type}=="0|7|14", \ 
      RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo [timeout] > /sys$$DEVPATH/timeout'"
      ```

      This rules file does not exist in RHEL 6 or 7 initiators, so you must create it using the following rule\.

      ```
      ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEMS=="scsi" , ATTRS{model}=="Storage Gateway", 
      RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo [timeout] > /sys$$DEVPATH/timeout'"
      ```

      To modify the timeout value in RHEL 6, use the following command, and then add the lines of code shown preceding\. 

      ```
      sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules
      ```

      To modify the timeout value in RHEL 7, use the following command, and then add the lines of code shown preceding\. 

      ```
      sudo su -c "echo 600 > /sys/block/[device name]/device/timeout"
      ```

   1. Set the *\[timeout\]* value to **600**\.

      This value represents a timeout of 600 seconds\.

1. Restart your system to ensure that the new configuration values take effect\.

   Before restarting, make sure that the results of all write operations to your volumes are flushed\. To do this, unmount storage volumes before restarting\.

1. You can test the configuration by using the following command\. 

   ```
   udevadm test [PATH_TO_ISCSI_DEVICE]
   ```

   This command shows the udev rules that are applied to the iSCSI device\.

## Configuring CHAP Authentication for Your iSCSI Targets<a name="ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorCHAP"></a>

Storage Gateway supports authentication between your gateway and iSCSI initiators by using Challenge\-Handshake Authentication Protocol \(CHAP\)\.Â CHAP provides protection against playback attacks by periodically verifying the identity of an iSCSI initiator as authenticated to access a volume and VTL device target\. 

**Note**  
CHAP configuration is optional but highly recommended\.

To set up CHAP, you must configure it both on the Storage Gateway console and in the iSCSI initiator software that you use to connect to the target\. Storage Gateway uses mutual CHAP, which is when the initiator authenticates the target and the target authenticates the initiator\.

**To set up mutual CHAP for your targets**

1. Configure CHAP on the Storage Gateway console, as discussed in [To configure CHAP for a VTL device target on the Storage Gateway console](#ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorCHAPConsole-tgw)\.

1. In your client initiator software, complete the CHAP configuration:
   + To configure mutual CHAP on a Windows client, see [To configure mutual CHAP on a Windows client](#ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorCHAPWindows)\.
   + To configure mutual CHAP on a Red Hat Linux client, see [To configure mutual CHAP on a Red Hat Linux client](#ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorCHAPLinux)\.<a name="ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorCHAPConsole-tgw"></a>

**To configure CHAP for a VTL device target on the Storage Gateway console**

In this procedure, you specify two secret keys that are used to read and write to a virtual tape\. These same keys are used in the procedure to configure the client initiator\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**\.

1. Choose your gateway, and then choose the **VTL Devices** tab to display all your VTL devices\.

1. Choose the device that you want to configure CHAP for\.

1. Provide the requested information in the **Configure CHAP Authentication** dialog box\.

   1. For **Initiator Name**, enter the name of your iSCSI initiator\. This name is an Amazon iSCSI qualified name \(IQN\) that is prepended by `iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:` followed by the target name\. The following is an example\.

      `iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:your-tape-device-name`

      You can find the initiator name by using your iSCSI initiator software\. For example, for Windows clients, the name is the value on the **Configuration** tab of the iSCSI initiator\. For more information, see [To configure mutual CHAP on a Windows client](#ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorCHAPWindows)\.
**Note**  
To change an initiator name, you must first disable CHAP, change the initiator name in your iSCSI initiator software, and then enable CHAP with the new name\.

   1. For **Secret used to Authenticate Initiator**, enter the secret requested\.

      This secret must be a minimum of 12 characters and a maximum of 16 characters long\. This value is the secret key that the initiator \(that is, the Windows client\) must know to participate in CHAP with the target\.

   1. For **Secret used to Authenticate Target \(Mutual CHAP\)**, enter the secret requested\.

      This secret must be a minimum of 12 characters and a maximum of 16 characters long\. This value is the secret key that the target must know to participate in CHAP with the initiator\.
**Note**  
The secret used to authenticate the target must be different than the secret to authenticate the initiator\.

   1. Choose **Save**\.

1. On the **VTL Devices** tab, confirm that the iSCSI CHAP authentication field is set to **true**\.<a name="ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorCHAPWindows"></a>

**To configure mutual CHAP on a Windows client**

In this procedure, you configure CHAP in the Microsoft iSCSI initiator using the same keys that you used to configure CHAP for the volume on the console\.

1. If the iSCSI initiator is not already started, on the **Start** menu of your Windows client computer, choose **Run**, enter **iscsicpl\.exe**, and then choose **OK** to run the program\.

1. Configure mutual CHAP configuration for the initiator \(that is, the Windows client\):

   1. Choose the **Configuration** tab\.

       
**Note**  
The **Initiator Name** value is unique to your initiator and company\. The name shown preceding is the value that you used in the **Configure CHAP Authentication** dialog box of the Storage Gateway console\.  
The name shown in the example image is for demonstration purposes only\.

   1. Choose **CHAP**\.

   1. In the **iSCSI Initiator Mutual Chap Secret** dialog box, enter the mutual CHAP secret value\.

         
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/images/ConfigureChap_25.png)

      In this dialog box, you enter the secret that the initiator \(the Windows client\) uses to authenticate the target \(the storage volume\)\. This secret allows the target to read and write to the initiator\. This secret is the same as the secret entered into the **Secret used to Authenticate Target \(Mutual CHAP\)** box in the **Configure CHAP Authentication** dialog box\. For more information, see [Configuring CHAP Authentication for Your iSCSI Targets](#ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorCHAP)\.

   1. If the key that you entered is fewer than 12 characters or more than 16 characters long, an **Initiator CHAP secret** error dialog box appears\.

      Choose **OK**, and then enter the key again\.

         
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/images/ConfigureChap_27.png)

1. Configure the target with the initiator's secret to complete the mutual CHAP configuration\.

   1. Choose the **Targets** tab\.

         
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/images/ConfigureChap_29.png)

   1. If the target that you want to configure for CHAP is currently connected, disconnect the target by selecting it and choosing **Disconnect**\.

   1. Select the target that you want to configure for CHAP, and then choose **Connect**\.

         
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/images/ConfigureChap_30.png)

   1. In the **Connect to Target** dialog box, choose **Advanced**\.

         
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/images/ConfigureChap_35.png)

   1. In the **Advanced Settings** dialog box, configure CHAP\.

       

      1. Select **Enable CHAP log on**\.

      1. Enter the secret that is required to authenticate the initiator\. This secret is the same as the secret entered into the **Secret used to Authenticate Initiator** box in the **Configure CHAP Authentication** dialog box\. For more information, see [Configuring CHAP Authentication for Your iSCSI Targets](#ConfiguringiSCSIClientInitiatorCHAP)\.

      1. Select **Perform mutual authentication**\.

      1. To apply the changes, choose **OK**\.

   1. In the **Connect to Target** dialog box, choose **OK**\. 

1. If you provided the correct secret key, the target shows a status of **Connected**\.

**To configure mutual CHAP on a Red Hat Linux client**

In this procedure, you configure CHAP in the Linux iSCSI initiator using the same keys that you used to configure CHAP for the volume on the Storage Gateway console\.

1. Ensure that the iSCSI daemon is running and that you have already connected to a target\. If you have not completed these two tasks, see [Connecting to a Linux Client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/GettingStarted-create-tape-gateway.html#iscsi-vtl-linux)\.

1. Disconnect and remove any existing configuration for the target for which you are about to configure CHAP\.

   1. To find the target name and ensure it is a defined configuration, list the saved configurations using the following command\.

      ```
      sudo /sbin/iscsiadm --mode node
      ```

   1. Disconnect from the target\.

      The following command disconnects from the target named **myvolume** that is defined in the Amazon iSCSI qualified name \(IQN\)\. Change the target name and IQN as required for your situation\.

      ```
      sudo /sbin/iscsiadm --mode node --logout GATEWAY_IP:3260,1 iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume
      ```

   1. Remove the configuration for the target\.

      The following command removes the configuration for the **myvolume** target\.

      ```
      sudo /sbin/iscsiadm --mode node --op delete --targetname iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume
      ```

1. Edit the iSCSI configuration file to enable CHAP\.

   1. Get the name of the initiator \(that is, the client you are using\)\.

      The following command gets the initiator name from the `/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi` file\.

      ```
      sudo cat /etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi
      ```

      The output from this command looks like this:

      `InitiatorName=iqn.1994-05.com.redhat:8e89b27b5b8`

   1. Open the `/etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf` file\.

   1. Uncomment the following lines in the file and specify the correct values for *username*, *password*, *username\_in*, and *password\_in*\.

      ```
      node.session.auth.authmethod = CHAP
      node.session.auth.username = username
      node.session.auth.password = password
      node.session.auth.username_in = username_in
      node.session.auth.password_in = password_in
      ```

      For guidance on what values to specify, see the following table\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/initiator-connection-common.html)

   1. Save the changes in the configuration file, and then close the file\.

1. Discover and log in to the target\. To do so, follow the steps in [Connecting to a Linux Client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/GettingStarted-create-tape-gateway.html#iscsi-vtl-linux)\.
