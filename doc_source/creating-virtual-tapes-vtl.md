# Adding Virtual Tapes<a name="creating-virtual-tapes-vtl"></a>

You can add tapes in your Tape Gateway when you need them\. For information about how to create tapes, see [Creating Tapes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/GettingStartedCreateTapes.html)\. 

After your tape is created, you can find information about it on the **Tape overview** page\. By default, this list displays up to 1,000 tapes at a time, but the searches that you perform apply to all of your tapes\. You can use the search bar to find tapes that match a specific criteria, or to reduce the list to less than 1,000 tapes\. When your list contains 1,000 tapes or fewer, you can then sort your tapes in ascending or descending order by various properties\. For information about Tape Gateway tape quotas, see [AWS Storage Gateway quotas](resource-gateway-limits.md)\.
