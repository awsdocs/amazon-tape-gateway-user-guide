# Monitoring Storage Gateway<a name="Main_monitoring-gateways-common"></a>

This section describes how to monitor a gateway, including monitoring resources associated with the gateway, using Amazon CloudWatch\. You can monitor the gateway's upload buffer and cache storage\. You use the Storage Gateway console to view metrics and alarms for your gateway\. For example, you can view the number of bytes used in read and write operations, the time spent in read and write operations, and the time taken to retrieve data from the Amazon Web Services Cloud\. With metrics, you can track the health of your gateway and set up alarms to notify you when one or more metrics fall outside a defined threshold\.

Storage Gateway provides CloudWatch metrics at no additional charge\. Storage Gateway metrics are recorded for a period of two weeks\. By using these metrics, you can access historical information and get a better perspective on how your gateway and volumes are performing\. Storage Gateway also provides CloudWatch alarms, except high\-resolution alarms, at no additional charge\. For more information about CloudWatch pricing, see [Amazon CloudWatch pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/)\. For more information about CloudWatch, see [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html)\.

## Understanding gateway metrics<a name="MonitoringGateways-common"></a>

For the discussion in this topic, we define *gateway* metrics as metrics that are scoped to the gatewayâ€”that is, they measure something about the gateway\. Because a gateway contains one or more volumes, a gateway\-specific metric is representative of all volumes on the gateway\. For example, the `CloudBytesUploaded` metric is the total number of bytes that the gateway sent to the cloud during the reporting period\. This metric includes the activity of all the volumes on the gateway\.

When working with gateway metric data, you specify the unique identification of the gateway that you are interested in viewing metrics for\. To do this, you specify both the `GatewayId` and the `GatewayName` values\. When you want to work with metric for a gateway, you specify the gateway *dimension* in the metrics namespace, which distinguishes a gateway\-specific metric from a volume\-specific metric\. For more information, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch Metrics](GatewayMetrics-vtl-common.md#UsingCloudWatchConsole-vtl-common)\.

**Note**  
Some metrics return data points only when new data has been generated during the most recent monitoring period\.


| Metric | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| AvailabilityNotifications | Number of availability\-related health notifications generated by the gateway\. Use this metric with the `Sum` statistic to observe whether the gateway is experiencing any availability\-related events\. For details about the events, check your configured CloudWatch log group\. Unit: Number | 
| CacheHitPercent |  Percent of application reads served from the cache\. The sample is taken at the end of the reporting period\. Unit: Percent  | 
| CacheUsed |  The total number of bytes being used in the gateway's cache storage\. The sample is taken at the end of the reporting period\. Unit: Bytes  | 
| IoWaitPercent  |  Percent of time that the gateway is waiting on a response from the local disk\. Unit: Percent  | 
| MemTotalBytes |  Amount of RAM provisioned to the gateway VM, in bytes\. Unit: Bytes  | 
| MemUsedBytes |  Amount of RAM currently in use by the gateway VM, in bytes\. Unit: Bytes  | 
| QueuedWrites |  The number of bytes waiting to be written to AWS, sampled at the end of the reporting period for all volumes in the gateway\. These bytes are kept in your gateway's working storage\. Unit: Bytes  | 
| TotalCacheSize |  The total size of the cache in bytes\. The sample is taken at the end of the reporting period\. Unit: Bytes  | 
| UploadBufferPercentUsed |  Percent use of the gateway's upload buffer\. The sample is taken at the end of the reporting period\. Unit: Percent  | 
| UploadBufferUsed |  The total number of bytes being used in the gateway's upload buffer\. The sample is taken at the end of the reporting period\. Unit: Bytes  | 
| UserCpuPercent |  Percent of CPU time spent on gateway processing, averaged across all cores\. Unit: Percent  | 

## Dimensions for Storage Gateway metrics<a name="storagegateway-metric-dimensions"></a>

The CloudWatch namespace for the Storage Gateway service is `AWS/StorageGateway`\. Data is available automatically in 5\-minute periods at no charge\.


| Dimension | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  GatewayId, GatewayName |  These dimensions filter the data that you request to gateway\-specific metrics\. You can identify a gateway to work by the value for `GatewayId` or `GatewayName`\. If the name of your gateway was different for the time range that you are interested in viewing metrics, use the `GatewayId`\. Throughput and latency data of a gateway is based on all the volumes for the gateway\. For information about working with gateway metrics, see [Measuring Performance Between Your Gateway and AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/vgw/monitoring-volume-gateway.html#PerfGatewayAWS-common)\.   | 

## Monitoring the upload buffer<a name="PerfUploadBuffer-common"></a>

You can find information following about how to monitor a gateway's upload buffer and how to create an alarm so that you get a notification when the buffer exceeds a specified threshold\. By using this approach, you can add buffer storage to a gateway before it fills completely and your storage application stops backing up to AWS\.

You monitor the upload buffer in the same way in both the cached\-volume and Tape Gateway architectures\. For more information, see [How Tape Gateway works \(architecture\)](StorageGatewayConcepts.md)\.

**Note**  
The `WorkingStoragePercentUsed`, `WorkingStorageUsed`, and `WorkingStorageFree` metrics represent the upload buffer for stored volumes only before the release of the cached\-volume feature in Storage Gateway\. Now, use the equivalent upload buffer metrics `UploadBufferPercentUsed`, `UploadBufferUsed`, and `UploadBufferFree`\. These metrics apply to both gateway architectures\.


| Item of Interest | How to Measure | 
| --- | --- | 
| Upload buffer usage |  Use the `UploadBufferPercentUsed`, `UploadBufferUsed`, and `UploadBufferFree` metrics with the `Average` statistic\. For example, use the `UploadBufferUsed` with the `Average` statistic to analyze the storage usage over a time period\.  | <a name="PerfUploadBufferMeasuring-common"></a>

**To measure the percent of the upload buffer that is used**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. Choose the **StorageGateway: Gateway Metrics** dimension, and find the gateway that you want to work with\.

1. Choose the `UploadBufferPercentUsed` metric\.

1. For **Time Range**, choose a value\.

1. Choose the `Average` statistic\.

1. For **Period**, choose a value of 5 minutes to match the default reporting time\.

The resulting time\-ordered set of data points contains the percent used of the upload buffer\.

Using the following procedure, you can create an alarm using the CloudWatch console\. To learn more about alarms and thresholds, see [Creating CloudWatch Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.<a name="GatewayAlarm1-common"></a>

**To set an upper threshold alarm for a gateway's upload buffer**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. Choose **Create Alarm** to start the Create Alarm wizard\.

1. Specify a metric for your alarm:

   1. On the **Select Metric** page of the Create Alarm wizard, choose the **AWS/StorageGateway:GatewayId,GatewayName** dimension, and then find the gateway that you want to work with\.

   1. Choose the `UploadBufferPercentUsed` metric\. Use the `Average` statistic and a period of 5 minutes\.

   1. Choose **Continue**\.

1. Define the alarm name, description, and threshold:

   1. On the **Define Alarm** page of the Create Alarm wizard, identify your alarm by giving it a name and description in the **Name** and **Description** boxes\.

   1. Define the alarm threshold\.

   1. Choose **Continue**\.

1. Configure an email action for the alarm:

   1. On the **Configure Actions** page of the Create Alarm wizard, choose **Alarm** for **Alarm State**\.

   1. Choose **Choose or create email topic** for **Topic**\.

      To create an email topic means that you set up an Amazon SNS topic\. For more information about Amazon SNS, see [Set Up Amazon SNS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/US_SetupSNS.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide\.*

   1. For **Topic**, enter a descriptive name for the topic\.

   1. Choose **Add Action**\.

      

   1. Choose **Continue**\.

1. Review the alarm settings, and then create the alarm:

   1. On the **Review** page of the Create Alarm wizard, review the alarm definition, metric, and associated actions to take \(for example, sending an email notification\)\.

   1. After reviewing the alarm summary, choose **Save Alarm**\.

1. Confirm your subscription to the alarm topic:

   1. Open the Amazon SNS email that was sent to the email address that you specified when creating the topic\.

      The following image shows a typical email notification\.  
![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/images/GatewayMetrics_76.png)

   1. Confirm your subscription by clicking the link in the email\.

      A subscription confirmation appears\.

## Monitoring cache storage<a name="PerfCache-common"></a>

You can find information following about how to monitor a gateway's cache storage and how to create an alarm so that you get a notification when parameters of the cache pass specified thresholds\. Using this alarm, you know when to add cache storage to a gateway\.

You only monitor cache storage in the cached volumes architecture\. For more information, see [How Tape Gateway works \(architecture\)](StorageGatewayConcepts.md)\.


| Item of Interest | How to Measure | 
| --- | --- | 
| Total usage of cache |  Use the `CachePercentUsed` and `TotalCacheSize` metrics with the `Average` statistic\. For example, use the `CachePercentUsed` with the `Average` statistic to analyze the cache usage over a period of time\. The `TotalCacheSize` metric changes only when you add cache to the gateway\.  | 
| Percent of read requests that are served from the cache |  Use the `CacheHitPercent` metric with the `Average` statistic\. Typically, you want `CacheHitPercent` to remain high\.  | 
| Percent of the cache that is dirtyâ€”that is, it contains content that has not been uploaded to AWS |  Use the `CachePercentDirty` metrics with the `Average` statistic\. Typically, you want `CachePercentDirty` to remain low\.  | <a name="PerfCacheDirtyMeasuring-common1"></a>

**To measure the percent of a cache that is dirty for a gateway and all its volumes**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. Choose the **StorageGateway: Gateway Metrics** dimension, and find the gateway that you want to work with\.

1. Choose the `CachePercentDirty` metric\.

1. For **Time Range**, choose a value\.

1. Choose the `Average` statistic\.

1. For **Period**, choose a value of 5 minutes to match the default reporting time\.

The resulting time\-ordered set of data points contains the percentage of the cache that is dirty over the 5 minutes\.<a name="PerfCacheDirtyMeasuring-common"></a>

**To measure the percent of the cache that is dirty for a volume**

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)\.

1. Choose the **StorageGateway: Volume Metrics** dimension, and find the volume that you want to work with\.

1. Choose the `CachePercentDirty` metric\.

1. For **Time Range**, choose a value\.

1. Choose the `Average` statistic\.

1. For **Period**, choose a value of 5 minutes to match the default reporting time\.

The resulting time\-ordered set of data points contains the percentage of the cache that is dirty over the 5 minutes\.

## Understanding CloudWatch alarms<a name="cloudwatch-alarms"></a>

CloudWatch alarms monitor information about your gateway based on metrics and expressions\. You can add CloudWatch alarms for your gateway and view their statuses in the Storage Gateway console\. For more information about the metrics that are used to monitor Tape Gateway, see [Understanding gateway metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/Main_monitoring-gateways-common.html#MonitoringGateways-common) and [Understanding Virtual Tape Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/GatewayMetrics-vtl-common.html#monitoring-tape)\. For each alarm, you specify conditions that will trigger its ALARM state\. Alarm status indicators in the Storage Gateway console turn red when in the ALARM state, making it easier for you to monitor status proactively\. You can configure alarms to invoke actions automatically based on sustained changes in state\. For more information about CloudWatch alarms, see [Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

**Note**  
If you don't have permission to view CloudWatch, you can't view the alarms\.

For each activated gateway, we recommend that you create the following CloudWatch alarms:
+ High IO wait: `IoWaitpercent` >= 20 for 3 datapoints in 15 minutes
+ Cache percent dirty: `CachePercentDirty` > 80 for 4 datapoints within 20 minutes

For gateways on VMware host platforms with HA mode enabled, we also recommend these additional CloudWatch alarms:
+ Availability notifications: `AvailabilityNotifications` >= 1 for 1 datapoint within 5 minutes
+ Health notifications: `HealthNotifications` >= 1 for 1 datapoint within 5 minutes
**Note**  
You can set a health notification alarm only if the gateway had a previous health notification in CloudWatch\.

The following table describes the state of an alarm\. 


| State | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
|  **OK**  |  The metric or expression is within the defined threshold\.  | 
|  **Alarm**  |  The metric or expression is outside of the defined threshold\.  | 
|  **Insufficient data**  |  The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available for the metric to determine the alarm state\.  | 
|  **None**  |  No alarms are created for the gateway\. To create a new alarm, see [Creating a custom CloudWatch alarm for your gateway](#cloudwatch-alarms-create-alarm)\.  | 
|  **Unavailable**  |  The state of the alarm is unknown\. Choose **Unavailable** to view error information in the **Monitoring** tab\.  | 

## Creating recommended CloudWatch alarms for your gateway<a name="cloudwatch-alarms-create-recommended"></a>

When you create a new gateway using the Storage Gateway console, you can choose to create all recommended CloudWatch alarms automatically as part of the initial setup process\. For more information, see [Configure your Tape Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/create-gateway-vtl.html#configure-gateway-tape)\. If you want to add or update recommended CloudWatch alarms for an existing gateway, use the following procedure\.

**To add or update recommended CloudWatch alarms for an existing gateway**
**Note**  
This feature requires CloudWatch policy permissions, which are *not* automatically granted as part of the preconfigured Storage Gateway full access policy\. Make sure your security policy grants the following permissions before you attempt to create recommended CloudWatch alarms:  
`cloudwatch:PutMetricAlarm` \- create alarms
`cloudwatch:DisableAlarmActions` \- turn alarm actions off
`cloudwatch:EnableAlarmActions` \- turn alarm actions on
`cloudwatch:DeleteAlarms` \- delete alarms

1. Open the Storage Gateway console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/storagegateway/home/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**, then choose the gateway for which you want to create recommended CloudWatch alarms\.

1. On the gateway details page, choose the **Monitoring** tab\.

1. Under **Alarms**, choose **Create recommended alarms**\. The recommended alarms are created automatically\.

   The **Alarms** section lists all CloudWatch alarms for a specific gateway\. From here, you can select and delete one or more alarms, turn alarm actions on or off, and create new alarms\.

## Creating a custom CloudWatch alarm for your gateway<a name="cloudwatch-alarms-create-alarm"></a>

CloudWatch uses Amazon Simple Notification Service \(Amazon SNS\) to send alarm notifications when an alarm changes state\. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period that you specify, and performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods\. The action is a notification that's sent to an Amazon SNS topic\. You can create an Amazon SNS topic when you create a CloudWatch alarm\. For more information about Amazon SNS, see [What is Amazon SNS?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html) in the *Amazon Simple Notification Service Developer Guide*\.

**To create a CloudWatch alarm in the Storage Gateway console**

1. Open the Storage Gateway console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/storagegateway/home/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**, then choose the gateway for which you want to create an alarm\.

1. On the gateway details page, choose the **Monitoring** tab\.

1. Under **Alarms**, choose **Create alarm** to open the CloudWatch console\.

1. Use the CloudWatch console to create the type of alarm that you want\. You can create the following types of alarms:
   + Static threshold alarm: An alarm based on a set threshold for a chosen metric\. The alarm enters the ALARM state when the metric breaches the threshold for a specified number of evaluation periods\.

     To create a static threshold alarm, see [Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on a static threshold](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ConsoleAlarms.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
   + Anomaly detection alarm: Anomaly detection mines past metric data and creates a model of expected values\. You set a value for the anomaly detection threshold, and CloudWatch uses this threshold with the model to determine the "normal" range of values for the metric\. A higher value for the threshold produces a thicker band of "normal" values\. You can choose to activate the alarm only when the metric value is above the band of expected values, only when it's below the band, or when it's above or below the band\.

     To create an anomaly detection alarm, see [Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on anomaly detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Anomaly_Detection_Alarm.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
   + Metric math expression alarm: An alarm based one or more metrics used in a math expression\. You specify the expression, threshold, and evaluation periods\.

     To create a metric math expression alarm, see [Creating a CloudWatch alarm based on a metric math expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create-alarm-on-metric-math-expression.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
   + Composite alarm: An alarm that determines its alarm state by watching the alarm states of other alarms\. A composite alarm can help you reduce alarm noise\.

     To create a composite alarm, see [Creating a composite alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.

1. After you create the alarm in the CloudWatch console, return to the Storage Gateway console\. You can view the alarm by doing one of the following:
   + In the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**, then choose the gateway for which you want to view alarms\. On the **Details** tab, under **Alarms**, choose **CloudWatch Alarms**\.
   + In the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**, choose the gateway for which you want to view alarms, then choose the **Monitoring** tab\.

     The **Alarms** section lists all of the CloudWatch alarms for a specific gateway\. From here, you can select and delete one or more alarms, turn alarm actions on or off, and create new alarms\.
   + In the navigation pane, choose **Gateways**, then choose the alarm state of the gateway for which you want to view alarms\.

For information about how to edit or delete an alarm, see [Editing or deleting a CloudWatch alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Edit-CloudWatch-Alarm.html)\.

**Note**  
When you delete a gateway using the Storage Gateway console, all CloudWatch alarms associated with the gateway are also automatically deleted\.
