**Note**  
If you require FIPS 140\-2 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS through a command line interface or an API, use a FIPS\-compliant endpoint\. For more information, see [Federal Information Processing Standard \(FIPS\) 140\-2](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fips/)\.  
The FIPS service endpoint is only available in some AWS Regions\. For more information, see [Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sg.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.  
FIPS is not supported for Tape Gateways on Snowball Edge devices\.
   + **VPC hosted** \- Your gateway communicates with AWS through a private connection with your VPC, allowing you to control your network settings\. If you select this option, you must specify an existing VPC endpoint by choosing its VPC endpoint ID from the drop\-down menu, or by providing its VPC endpoint DNS name or IP address\.
**Note**  
VPC hosted endpoints are not supported for Tape Gateways on Snowball Edge devices\.

1. In the **Gateway connection options** section, for **Connection options**, choose how to identify your gateway to AWS\. You can choose from the following options:
   + **IP address** \- Provide the IP address of your gateway in the corresponding field\. This IP address must be public or accessible from within your current network, and you must be able to connect to it from your web browser\.

     You can obtain the gateway IP address by logging into the gateway's local console from your hypervisor client, or by copying it from your Amazon EC2 instance details page\.
   + **Activation key** \- Provide the activation key for your gateway in the corresponding field\. You can generate an activation key using the gateway's local console\. Choose this option if your gateway's IP address is unavailable\.

1. Choose **Next** to proceed\.

Now that you have chosen how you want your gateway to connect to AWS, you need to activate the gateway\. For instructions, see [Review settings and activate your Tape Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/tgw/create-gateway-vtl.html#review-and-activate-tape)\.
