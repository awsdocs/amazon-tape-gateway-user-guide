# Sign Up for AWS Storage Gateway<a name="GettingStartedSignUpStep1-common"></a>

To use Storage Gateway, you need an Amazon Web Services account that gives you access to all AWS resources, forums, support, and usage reports\. You aren't charged for any of the services unless you use them\. If you already have an Amazon Web Services account, you can skip this step\. 

**To sign up for Amazon Web Services account**

1. Open [https://portal\.aws\.amazon\.com/billing/signup](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)\.

1. Follow the online instructions\.

   Part of the sign\-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a verification code on the phone keypad\.

   When you sign up for an AWS account, an *AWS account root user* is created\. The root user has access to all AWS services and resources in the account\. As a security best practice, [assign administrative access to an administrative user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html), and use only the root user to perform [tasks that require root user access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html)\.
