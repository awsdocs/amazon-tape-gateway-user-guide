# Accessing AWS Storage Gateway<a name="WhatIsAPIIntro"></a>

You can use the [Storage Gateway Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/home) to perform various gateway configuration and management tasks\. The Getting Started section and various other sections of this guide use the console to illustrate gateway functionality\.

To enable browser access to the Storage Gateway console, ensure that your browser has access to the Storage Gateway API endpoint\. For more information, see [Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sg.html) in the *AWS General Reference*\.

Additionally, you can use the AWS Storage Gateway API to programmatically configure and manage your gateways\. For more information about the API, see [API Reference for Storage Gateway](AWSStorageGatewayAPI.md)\. 

You can also use the AWS SDKs to develop applications that interact with Storage Gateway\. The AWS SDKs for Java, \.NET, and PHP wrap the underlying Storage Gateway API to simplify your programming tasks\. For information about downloading the SDK libraries, see [Sample Code Libraries](http://aws.amazon.com/code)\.
